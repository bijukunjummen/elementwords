== Background

This is Sara Biju's STEM project for Oak Hills Elementary school, Beaverton. The project aims to generate words from Chemical Element symbols, for eg.

* OPtICs from Oxygen(O), Platinum(Pt), Iodine(I), Caesium(Cs)
* PHoBiC : Phosphorus(P), Holmium(Ho), Bismuth(B), Carbon(C)


== Details
This is how the project works

* The list of elements and their symbols are loaded up
* The list of a words list is loaded up
* Words are generated by comibining two elements at a time, three elements at a time and 4 elements at a time.
* Real words are checked against the words list and recorded

We stop at 4 elements at a time as the numbers turn out to be too large to handle beyond that. With just combining 4 elements at a time
the number of possible words generated is 118 * 118 * 118 * 118 which is around 200 million
